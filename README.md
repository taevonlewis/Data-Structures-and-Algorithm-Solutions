## Data Structures and Algorithm Solutions

This repository is a comprehensive collection of solutions to coding problems from various platforms including Codewars, Leetcode, Binary Search, Algo Expert, GeeksforGeeks, and others.

### Repository Structure

The 'fully written solutions' folder contains problems that have been tackled from scratch. Here is what you can expect:

- C++: Each problem has a corresponding **`.cpp`** file and a related header file. The header files are included in the main function, which calls all the headers. If you want to focus on a single problem, you can comment out the function calls for the other problems.
- Python: Similarly, Python solutions are neatly encapsulated within individual **`.py`** files, following Pythonic conventions for clarity and efficiency.

### Programming Languages

The problems in this repository have been solved using:

- C++
- Python

### Exploring the Solutions

Feel free to dive into the code. The aim of this repository is not just to provide solutions, but also to serve as a learning resource. Whether you're preparing for a technical interview, learning a new data structure, or simply love solving problems, there's something here for you.

# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Solutions
Collection of every solved problem from Codewars, Leetcode, Binary Search, Algo Expert, GeeksforGeeks, etc.

The 'fully written solutions' folder includes problems completed by scratch. Each C++ file has it's respective header and that header is included in the main function. The main function calls all headers. Function calls can simply be commented out to view a singular or specific problem's solution.

*All problems completed in C++*

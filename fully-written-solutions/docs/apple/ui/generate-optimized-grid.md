# Problem Statement

You are tasked with developing a feature for an iOS shopping application that needs to display a set of product recommendations based on user interactions and preferences. The recommendations should be displayed in a grid layout, and the layout should adapt dynamically based on the screen size and orientation of the device.

To achieve the best user experience, you need to ensure that the grid layout is optimized using advanced graph algorithms and dynamic programming techniques. The layout should rearrange itself efficiently when the user rotates the device or when the screen size changes.

## Requirements

1. Implement a function `generateOptimizedGridLayout` that takes an array of product items and the screen size as input and returns a 2D array representing the optimized grid layout.
2. Each product item has a unique identifier, name, and size.
3. The grid layout should be optimized to minimize the empty space and balance the number of items in each row and column.
4. The function should handle dynamic changes in screen size and orientation efficiently.
5. Use Swift syntax for the implementation.

## Function Signature

```swift
func generateOptimizedGridLayout(items: [ProductItem], screenSize: CGSize) -> [[ProductItem]]
```

## Input

- `items`: An array of `ProductItem` objects, where each `ProductItem` has the following structure:
  ```swift
  struct ProductItem {
      let id: Int
      let name: String
      let size: CGSize
  }
  ```
- `screenSize`: A `CGSize` object representing the size of the screen.

## Output

- A 2D array of `ProductItem` objects representing the optimized grid layout.

## Example

```swift
let items = [
    ProductItem(id: 1, name: "Item 1", size: CGSize(width: 50, height: 50)),
    ProductItem(id: 2, name: "Item 2", size: CGSize(width: 50, height: 50)),
    ProductItem(id: 3, name: "Item 3", size: CGSize(width: 50, height: 50)),
    ProductItem(id: 4, name: "Item 4", size: CGSize(width: 50, height: 50))
]

let screenSize = CGSize(width: 200, height: 400)

let optimizedGrid = generateOptimizedGridLayout(items: items, screenSize: screenSize)

// Expected output could be a 2x2 grid layout, for example:
// [
//     [ProductItem(id: 1, name: "Item 1", size: CGSize(width: 50, height: 50)), ProductItem(id: 2, name: "Item 2", size: CGSize(width: 50, height: 50))],
//     [ProductItem(id: 3, name: "Item 3", size: CGSize(width: 50, height: 50)), ProductItem(id: 4, name: "Item 4", size: CGSize(width: 50, height: 50))]
// ]
```

## Constraints

- The function should efficiently handle up to 1000 product items.
- The screen size dimensions will be positive integers not exceeding 5000.
- Assume all product items have non-zero, positive dimensions.

## Notes

- Consider using dynamic programming to optimize the grid layout.
- The function should be able to adapt the grid layout in real-time as the screen size changes, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Ensure that the layout is visually appealing and user-friendly.
